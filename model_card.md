### Output:

- **Grade Class**  
    - **GradeClass**: Classification of students' grades based on GPA:
        - 0: 'A' (GPA >= 3.5)
        - 1: 'B' (3.0 <= GPA < 3.5)
        - 2: 'C' (2.5 <= GPA < 3.0)
        - 3: 'D' (2.0 <= GPA < 2.5)
        - 4: 'F' (GPA < 2.0)


**Model Architecture:**  

## Performance
Accuracy: 70.2%

The model correctly predicts student grade classes 70.2% of the time. This suggests a reasonable balance between model complexity and generalization, making it suitable for applications with similar datasets.

## Limitations

Interpretability: While Random Forests offer feature importance scores, they are still more complex and harder to interpret compared to simpler models like Decision Trees or Logistic Regression.
Training Time: As the number of trees and data size increases, training can become slower, especially for large datasets.
Handling Imbalanced Data: If the target classes are imbalanced, Random Forest may struggle with underrepresented classes, leading to a bias toward the majority class.

## Trade-offs

Accuracy vs. Complexity: Increasing the number of trees or their depth can improve accuracy but at the cost of longer training times and potential overfitting. Conversely, reducing complexity (e.g., fewer trees, lower depth) speeds up training but may reduce accuracy.
Interpretability vs. Performance: Random Forests provide higher accuracy than simpler models but are less interpretable, which may be a drawback when understanding decision-making processes is crucial.
Overfitting vs. Generalization: The use of many trees and random sampling in Random Forests helps prevent overfitting, but further tuning (e.g., max depth, min samples split) is needed to balance model performance on training vs. test data.
